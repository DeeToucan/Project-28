# TwoEggOmlet

    *khm-khm* Hello, *hm-hm-hm*, my name is Dondie the mose ADEQUATE of omlet with a master
in worldwide cuisine *hm-hm-hmmm*

    The first step to make the FINEST omlettte in in worldwide cuisine is to crack the egg 
on a hard surface, hard enough so that the egg shell breaks open and to pour the yoke, and 
egg whites to a seprate bowl. Do this to for two eggs. *hm-hm* 

    So after you have poured the yoke into the bowl, you should now get a whisk and STIR the eggs until it becomes fully yellow and your arm muscles begin to ache. 
This is to ensure the omlettte is fluffy in texture.

    NOW, after the VIGOROUS stirring process you mouse turn on your frying pan on the HOTTEST tempature and pour the egg on it. 
This is a good time to add cheese or othere addtitives to our MASTER peice.

    Finally, you just FOLD the omlette in on it's self to complete the dish. I assume you may enjoy the WORLD CLASS recipe;
